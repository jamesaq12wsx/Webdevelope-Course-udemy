    <p>The first Earth Day celebrations took place in two
      thousand colleges and universities, roughly ten thousand primary and secondary schools,
      and hundreds of communities across the United States. More importantly, it "brought 20 million Americans out
      into the spring sunshine for peaceful demonstrations in favor of environmental reform." It now is observed in 192 countries,
      and coordinated by the nonprofit Earth Day Network, chaired by the first Earth Day 1970 organizer
      Denis Hayes, according to whom Earth Day is now "the largest secular holiday in the world, celebrated by more than a
      billion people every year." Environmental groups have sought to make Earth Day into a day of action
      to change human behavior and provoke policy changes.

      Mobilizing 200 million people in 141 countries and
      lifting the status of environmental issues onto the
      world stage, Earth Day activities in 1990 gave a huge
      boost to recycling efforts worldwide and helped pave
      the way for the 1992 United Nations Earth Summit in
      Rio de Janeiro. Unlike the first Earth Day in 1970,
      this 20th Anniversary was waged with stronger marketing
      tools, greater access to television and radio, and multimillion-dollar budgets.

      Earth Day 2000 combined the ambitious spirit of the
      first Earth Day with the international grassroots
      activism of Earth Day 1990. This was the first year
      that Earth Day used the Internet as its principal
      organizing tool, and it proved invaluable nationally
      and internationally.
